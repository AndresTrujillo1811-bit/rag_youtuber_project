# RAG lab - The Youtuber


This project is about to create a RAG chatbot that answer questions about Data Engineering based on the youtuber transcripts who teaches Data Engineering. This project uses PydanticAI, LanceDB, FastAPI & Streamlit.

It allows you to:

- Ingest the transcripts into a vector database in LanceDB. 
- Query the knowledge base to a FastAPI backend
- Interact with an Agent based on the knowledge base though the FastAPI backend in a Streamlit frontend making questions or sending messages. 
  
The goal with this project is to improve the learning experience by using the provided transcripts content.
